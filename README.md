📊 Customer Churn Analysis – A Data-Driven Approach
📝 Overview
Customer churn is a major challenge for businesses, and analyzing customer behavior helps in understanding the factors contributing to churn. This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer churn using Python and data visualization techniques.

By leveraging Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, we explore the dataset and uncover key insights to help businesses reduce churn and improve customer retention strategies.

📂 Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of customer details, subscription information, and churn status. Each row represents a unique customer, containing information such as:

Demographic details (e.g., age, senior citizen status, gender)
Subscription details (e.g., internet type, phone service, streaming services)
Financial details (e.g., average monthly charges, total charges)
Churn status (indicating whether a customer has left the service)
🔹 Data Preprocessing
Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned and prepared:
✅ Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
✅ Removed duplicates to ensure data integrity.
✅ Converted categorical variables for better analysis.
✅ Created new derived features to enhance insights.

🔍 Key Analyses & Insights
📌 1. Churn Distribution
Overall churn rate: ~26.54% of customers have churned.
Churn visualization:
Pie charts & bar plots show that a significant portion of customers leave the service.
A class imbalance exists, meaning more customers stay than leave.
📌 2. Demographic Analysis
Senior citizens tend to churn more than younger customers.
Gender does not significantly impact churn, as churn rates are fairly equal across genders.
Customers with multiple lines have lower churn rates compared to those with a single line.
📌 3. Service-Based Analysis
Internet service type influences churn:
DSL and Fiber Optic customers have different churn trends.
Customers with Fiber Optic services churn more frequently, possibly due to higher costs or technical issues.
Phone service vs. multiple lines:
Single-line customers churn more than those with multiple lines.
Streaming services impact churn:
Customers with both Streaming TV & Movies tend to churn less.
Suggests bundling services can improve retention.
📌 4. Financial Analysis
Average monthly charges have a strong correlation with churn:
Higher charges → Higher churn rate.
Customers paying more than the median monthly charges tend to leave the service.
Contract type matters:
Monthly contract customers churn more than yearly or two-year contracts.
Long-term contracts help in retaining customers for a longer duration.
Paperless billing and churn:
Customers with paperless billing are more likely to churn, possibly due to difficulty in tracking payments.
📊 Data Visualizations
Data insights were illustrated using:
📌 Bar charts – To compare churn rates across different categories.
📌 Pie charts – To visualize churn proportions.
📌 Boxplots & histograms – To analyze numerical features like monthly charges.
📌 Heatmaps – To check feature correlations and interactions.

Each visualization helps in identifying trends and patterns in customer behavior.

📌 Conclusion & Business Impact
✅ High churn is linked to higher charges and monthly contracts.
✅ Bundling services and offering discounts for long-term contracts can help retain customers.
✅ Senior citizens and Fiber Optic users need better engagement strategies.
✅ Paperless billing customers may require reminders or incentives to prevent churn.
